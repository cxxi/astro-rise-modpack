## Updating the Modpack

If you installed the pack using the `git clone` method, updating is simple:
1.  Make sure MultiMC is closed.
2.  Run the installer script again from within your instance folder:
    ```bash
    ./installer.sh client 
    ```
The script will automatically download the latest changes before applying them.

If you installed from a ZIP file, you follow the installation guide again with the new ZIP file.
